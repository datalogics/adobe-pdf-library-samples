/*
 * RemoteGoToActions is similar to LaunchActions. The program generates a PDF file
 * with an annotation, in the form of a rectangle. Click on the rectangle shown in this
 * PDF file and a separate PDF file opens.
 * 
 * RemoteGoToActions differs from LaunchActions in that it includes a RemoteDestination object.
 * This object describes the rectangle used in the PDF file in a series of statements at the command prompt. 
 *
 * For more detail see the description of the AnnotationCopyPaste sample program on our Developer’s site, 
 * http://dev.datalogics.com/adobe-pdf-library/sample-program-descriptions/net-sample-programs/working-with-actions-in-pdf-files#remotegotoactions
