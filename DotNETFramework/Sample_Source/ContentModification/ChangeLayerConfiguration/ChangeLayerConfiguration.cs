/*
 * This sample changes the On/Off configuration for a set of Optional Content Groups,
 * or layers, within a PDF document. By changing the On or Off state in the default
 * configuration, the sample makes the layers visible or invisible when opened in a 
 * viewer like Adobe Acrobat.
 * 
 * The sample changes the states of the layers in the document called Layers.pdf and
 * saves the result to a new PDF document.
 * 
 * For more detail see the description of the ChangeLayerConfiguration sample program on our Developer's site,

                /*
                 * The OptionalContentConfig hold three properties that affect initial state:
                 * the BaseState, the ON array, and the OFF array.  These properties can
                 * be used in three different ways to get the same combination of visible
                 * and invisible layers when the document is first displayed.
                 * 
                 * The Layers.pdf file has four layers: 'Layer 1', 'Layer 2', 'Layer 3',
                 * and 'Guides and Grids'.  By default, the first 3 layers are on,
                 * and 'Guides and Grids' is off.  We want to create a new document with the
                 * following state:
                 *  o   Layer 1 = OFF
                 *  o   Layer 2 = OFF
                 *  o   Layer 3 = ON
                 *  o   Guides and Grids = ON
                 * 
                 * There are three ways to achieve this:
                 * 
                 * METHOD ONE:
                 *  We set the BaseState to OFF, and add 'Layer 3' and 'Guides and Grids' to
                 *  the ON array.  The BaseState is a default state for ALL layers in a PDF --
                 *  all layers will take on this state unless they are included in the ON array.
                 *  Note that the OFF should be empty in this case.
                 * 
                 * METHOD TWO:
                 *  We set the BaseState to ON, and add 'Layer 1' and 'Layer 2' to the OFF
                 *  array.  This method is the opposite of method one: all layers are
                 *  automatically made visible, then any layers in the OFF array are toggled.
                 *  The ON array should be empty with this method.  This is the most common way 
                 *  of specifying default layer visibility.
                 * 
                 * METHOD THREE:
                 *  We set the BaseState to Unchanged, add 'Layer 1' and 'Layer 2' to the OFF
                 *  array, and 'Layer 3' and 'Guides and Grids' to the ON array.  The Unchanged
                 *  BaseState means that any layers that are not in the ON or OFF array will not
                 *  be affected by this OptionalContentConfig.
                 * 
                 * Note that if the Unchanged BaseState is used in the default OptionalContentConfig
                 * and there are layers that are not included in either the ON or OFF array, the
                 * visibility state of those layers is undefined.  For this reason, it is strongly
                 * recommended to use methods one or two in the default OptionalContentConfig.
                 * Also note that with method three, placing the same layer in both the ON and OFF
                 * arrays will lead to unpredictable behavior; however, the library will not
                 * prevent this situation.  Use care when using method three.
                 * 
                 * For our demonstration, we will use method one.

                // Layers.pdf, it had the 'Guides and Grids' layer in the OFF
                // array; if we leave it in there, it will appear in BOTH
                // the ON and OFF arrays and cause unpredictable behavior.
